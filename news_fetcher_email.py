     "summary":"Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggering the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. Fighting continues along an approximately 1,000 km eastern front across Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv oblasts, with Russian forces making slow incremental gains. Ukraine has responded with long-range drone strikes deep into Russian territory, hitting oil refineries, airfields, and Moscow itself. NATO allies have committed over $100B in military and financial aid, including F-16s, ATACMS, and Patriot systems. Casualty figures on both sides are estimated in the hundreds of thousands. Diplomatic efforts remain deadlocked; no credible peace framework has emerged and the war shows no sign of ending.",

The Gaza Strip has been subjected to sustained bombardment and ground operations, with Palestinian death tolls exceeding 45,000 according to Gaza health authorities, the majority civilians. A brief ceasefire in late 2023 allowed some hostage releases but fighting quickly resumed. The UN has declared famine conditions in northern Gaza; virtually all civilian infrastructure has been destroyed. International pressure for a permanent ceasefire has intensified but negotiations between Hamas and Israel, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, have repeatedly collapsed. The West Bank has simultaneously seen rising settler violence and military raids.",

Over 12 million people have been displaced — one of the world's worst humanitarian crises — with famine declared in several regions. RSF forces have committed widespread atrocities in Darfur that international investigators have characterised as genocide, echoing the 2003 massacres. Khartoum has been devastated by sustained urban combat, its infrastructure reduced to rubble. International attention and humanitarian access remain grossly insufficient; no meaningful peace process is underway.",

Since October 2023, Houthis have launched hundreds of drone and missile strikes on commercial and military shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, forcing major container lines to reroute around Africa and driving up global freight costs. The US, UK, and allied forces have conducted extensive retaliatory strikes on Houthi weapons infrastructure, with limited lasting effect. Separately, a fragile UN-brokered truce between Houthis and the Saudi-backed government has reduced large-scale ground combat in much of the country, though no political settlement is in sight and Yemen remains one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.",

     "summary":"A broad resistance coalition — including the People's Defence Force (PDF) and ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) such as the Arakan Army, TNLA, and MNDAA — has made dramatic territorial gains against the military junta since a coordinated offensive launched in late 2023. Key border towns including Laukkai, Myawaddy, and significant stretches of Shan State have fallen to resistance forces, severing junta control of major trade routes to China and Thailand. The military has lost over a third of its territory and introduced conscription as manpower dwindles. China has mediated fragile ceasefires in border areas to protect its Belt and Road investments, while the US and EU have tightened sanctions on the regime.",

Military juntas ruling all three countries have expelled French and other Western forces and invited Russia's Africa Corps (formerly Wagner Group) as security partners — a shift that has not improved security outcomes. Burkina Faso's junta has lost control of an estimated 40–60% of national territory. ECOWAS sanctions have proved ineffective. The region faces acute food insecurity and has become a launchpad for attacks reaching coastal West African states including Benin, Togo, and Ghana.",

     "summary":"M23 rebels, armed and directed by Rwanda according to UN experts, have seized substantial territory in eastern DRC including key parts of Goma, the commercial capital of North Kivu with a population of over one million. The offensive is the most significant territorial shift in the Congo's decades-long conflict and has displaced over six million people in the east alone. Direct DRC-Rwanda confrontation risk is high, with both governments exchanging artillery fire across the border. MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping mission, is drawing down amid widespread hostility. The Nairobi and Luanda peace processes have produced repeated ceasefires that collapse within days. Coltan and gold mines remain central to the conflict economy.",

Despite losing some territory to Somali National Army offensives in 2022–23, the group has rebounded and continues to raise funds through taxation and extortion across its territory. The AU Transition Mission (ATMIS) is drawing down on schedule, creating security vacuums that al-Shabaab is actively exploiting. The federal government in Mogadishu is beset by clan disputes and fiscal crisis. Drought and recurrent flooding have driven acute food insecurity, making Somalia one of the world's most complex humanitarian emergencies.",

     "summary":"Armed gang coalitions led by the G9 federation and the Viv Ansanm alliance have seized control of much of Port-au-Prince and key provincial towns, triggering a full humanitarian and governance collapse. Hospitals, schools, and government offices have been overwhelmed or shut entirely. A Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) deployed in mid-2024 but is severely under-resourced and has struggled to make security gains. Over 700,000 people are internally displaced; famine conditions have been declared. Kidnapping for ransom is endemic across the country. A transitional presidential council is attempting to stabilise governance ahead of planned elections, but the political roadmap remains contested.",

President Petro's flagship 'total peace' policy led to multiple negotiated ceasefires, virtually all of which have collapsed. The Catatumbo conflict in early 2024 saw intense fighting between the ELN and FARC dissidents, displacing over 30,000 civilians. Coca production and cocaine trafficking continue at record levels, funding all armed groups. Violence against social leaders, indigenous communities, and former FARC combatants who demobilised under the 2016 peace deal remains a persistent and largely unpunished problem.",

Post-election unrest following the contested October 2024 presidential election resulted in over 300 deaths, with opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane disputing results from exile and calling for sustained protests. The combination of insurgency and political crisis has left Mozambique facing serious instability on multiple fronts simultaneously.",

China's grey-zone operations — using coast guard vessels, maritime militia, and daily incursions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone — have intensified under Xi Jinping. US arms sales, Congressional visits, and Taiwan's own defence budget increases have further heightened cross-strait tensions. Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te, elected in January 2024, maintains a firm stance while avoiding direct provocation. TSMC's dominance of advanced semiconductor manufacturing gives Taiwan extraordinary global strategic weight, making a Chinese move against the island a direct threat to global supply chains.",

Chinese coast guard vessels have used water cannons, military-grade lasers, and physical obstruction against Philippine resupply missions, injuring Filipino sailors and seizing supplies. The Philippines has invoked its mutual defence treaty with the US, which has reinforced its alliance posture and stationed additional forces at new Philippine bases. ASEAN negotiations for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea have stalled. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei also have contested overlapping claims.",

In exchange, North Korea is believed to be receiving advanced missile and satellite technology, conventional weapons, and economic relief. Kim Jong-un has conducted multiple ICBM tests demonstrating the capability to strike the US mainland. Pyongyang has formally declared South Korea a hostile foreign state, dismantled inter-Korean liaison infrastructure, and launched balloons carrying trash and propaganda into the South.

     "summary":"Iran's uranium enrichment has reached 60% purity — close to the 90% weapons-grade threshold — at facilities where IAEA inspectors have significantly reduced access. Tehran's 'Axis of Resistance' proxy network — Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, and various Iraqi Shia militias — has been severely weakened but not dismantled following Israel's 2024 campaign. A direct Iran-Israel exchange of fire in April 2024 (300+ Iranian drones and missiles followed by an Israeli retaliatory strike) marked a historic first direct confrontation between the two countries. Intermittent US-Iran nuclear negotiations continue but have not produced a successor agreement to the 2015 JCPOA.

The regime deployed massive repression against post-election protests, with over 2,400 arrested and more than two dozen killed. González went into exile while opposition leader María Corina Machado remains in Venezuela under constant threat of arrest, continuing to organise from hiding. The US, EU, and most Latin American democracies have refused to recognise Maduro's claimed mandate. Venezuela's migrant diaspora now exceeds 7.7 million — one of the world's largest displacement crises — driven by economic collapse and political persecution.",

A transitional government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly Abu Mohammad al-Jolani) is consolidating control in major cities while navigating competing factions, IS sleeper cell attacks, and a contested periphery. Turkish forces and Turkey-backed groups hold the north, US-backed Kurdish SDF forces control the northeast, and Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes destroying Syrian military infrastructure. International sanctions relief is conditional on transition governance credibility. Syria faces one of the world's most acute reconstruction challenges with an estimated $400B in war damage.",

The ethnic Serb-majority north of Kosovo operates parallel institutions funded by Belgrade, creating persistent governance friction. Periodic flashpoints — including armed incidents at the Jarinje border crossing and clashes over Kosovo's attempts to assert authority in the north — have kept NATO's KFOR peacekeeping force on heightened alert. The EU-brokered Brussels Agreement to normalise relations has not been implemented by either side. Serbia's President Vučić navigates between EU accession aspirations and traditional Moscow alignment, complicating Western leverage.",

A simultaneous Amhara insurgency (the Fano militia) has opened a second front, with fighting in and around Gondar, Bahir Dar, and the Amhara highlands. The Oromo Liberation Army continues operations in Oromia. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government faces simultaneous insurgencies it cannot fully suppress while also pursuing an assertive foreign policy, including a push for Red Sea access that is straining relations with Somalia, Eritrea, and Djibouti.

Lebanon elected a new president and formed a functioning government for the first time in years, signalling a fragile political opening. However, Hezbollah remains armed, politically entrenched, and backed by Iran. Reconstruction of southern Lebanon will cost an estimated $10B. The Lebanese economy — already in freefall since the 2019 financial collapse — is struggling to attract the international support needed for stabilisation and recovery.",
